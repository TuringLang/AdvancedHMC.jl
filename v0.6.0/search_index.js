This means  that at the beginning of each trajectory we sample a step size ϵ by adding or  subtracting from the nominal/base step size ϵ0 some random proportion of ϵ0,  with the proportion specified by jitter, i.e. ϵ = ϵ0 - jitter * ϵ0 * rand(). p Jittering might help alleviate issues related to poor interactions with a fixed step size:\n\nIn regions with high \"curvature\" the current choice of step size might mean over-shoot  leading to almost all steps being rejected. Randomly sampling the step size at the  beginning of the trajectories can therefore increase the probability of escaping such high-curvature regions.\nExact periodicity of the simulated trajectories might occur, i.e. you might be so unlucky as to simulate the trajectory forwards in time L ϵ and ending up at the same point (which results in non-ergodicity; see Section 3.2 in [1]). If momentum is refreshed before each trajectory, then this should not happen exactly but it can still be an issue in practice. Randomly choosing the step-size ϵ might help alleviate such problems.\n\nReferences\n\nNeal, R. M. (2011). MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics. Handbook of Markov chain Monte Carlo, 2(11), 2.

The order of this integration signifies its rate of convergence. Any algorithm with a finite time step size will have numerical errors, and the order is related to this error. For a second-order algorithm, this error scales as the second power of the time step, hence, the name second-order. High-order integrators are usually complex to code and have a limited region of convergence; hence they do not allow arbitrarily large time steps. A second-order integrator is suitable for our purpose. Hence we opt for the leapfrog integrator. It is called leapfrog due to the ways this algorithm is written, where the positions and velocities of particles leap over each other.
