The order of this integration signifies its rate of convergence. Any alogrithm with a finite time step size will have numerical errors and the order is related to this error. For a second-order algorithm, this error scales as the second power of the time step, hence, the name second-order. High-order intergrators are usually complex to code and have a limited region of convergence, hence they do not allow arbitrarily large time steps. A second-order integrator is suitable for our purpose, hence we opt for the leapfrog integrator. It is called leapfrog due to the ways this algorithm is written, where the positions and velocities of particles leap over each other.

Furthermore, suppose positions are defined at times t_i t_i+1 t_i+2 dots  spaced at constant intervals dt, the velocities are defined at halfway times in between, denoted by t_i-12 t_i+12 t_i+32 dots  where t_i+1 - t_i + 12 = t_i + 12 - t_i = dt  2, and the accelerations bf a are defined only on integer times, just like the positions. Then the leapfrog integration scheme is given as: x_i = x_i-1 + v_i-12 dt quad v_i+12 = v_i-12 + a_i dt.
